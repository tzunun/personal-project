The historical data of each of the components is available from Quandl, you must have an account in order to obtain an API key.

The Quandl library can be installed as follows:

    Using conda
        conda install -c anaconda quandl
        or
        pip install quandl
        
    Using pip3 for python 3.
        pip3 install quandl

This project uses the data of the current (as of the day it was downloaded) S&P500 components list, therefore is not 100% historically accurate.
Some companies have been part of the of the S&P500 from its inception.  Others just a few months or sometimes days.  Therefore this project for the purpose
of getting some calculations done assumes that all the components have been part of the S&P500 for a period of about 18 years.

There are 504 companies that make up the S&P500 index. As of Nov 2, 2018 the data from the following companies is not available from Quandl 
with a free account.  I have not checked if with a paid account I can obtain the remaining data.  These can be downloaded manually from Yahoo Finance. 

    ANET Arista Networks Inc
    BF.B Brown Forman Inc Cl B
    BRK.B Berkshire Hath Hld Cl B
    EVRG Evergy Inc
    JEF Jefferies Financial Group Inc
